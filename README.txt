Your task is to split the tweets into sentences, tag them with a PoS tagger that we will provide, gather
some feature information from each tweet, learn models, and use these to classify topics and sentiments.
Sentiment analysis is an important, still emerging topic in computational linguistics in which we quantify
subjective aspects of language. These can range from binary opinions in social media (as in this assignment)
for marketing, to a spectrum of cognitive behaviours, to help diagnoses in health care.
